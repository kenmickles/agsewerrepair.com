        <h1>Video Camera Inspection</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="img/video-camera-inspection.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>The What of Video Camera Inspections:</h3>
        <p>Video camera inspection provides a visual inspection of underground sewer lines and other piping to determine the condition inside the pipe. It provides a unique overview of the underground pipes without excavating the surrounding area.  Without a visual inspection using an in-line camera, the condition of a pipe line typically cannot be determined. Video cameras may be used to identify damages and obstructions that prevent proper flow or create backups.  The camera also verifies that obstructions have been removed and that the lines are clean following service.</p>

        <h3>Video Camera Inspections Diagnose Pipeline Issues:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Bellied pipe -</b> a sunken section of pipe due to ground or soil conditions,
        creating a valley that collects waste.</li>
          <li><b>Broken, cracked or collapsed pipe -</b> damaged pipes requiring repair or
        replacement.</li>
          <li><b>Corrosion -</b> deteriorated or broken pipes, causing collapses in the line
          and preventing proper flow.</li>
          <li><b>Offset pipe -</b> misaligned sewer pipes due to shifting soil, frozen ground.</li>
          <li><b>Blockage -</b> grease, roots, waste build up, or a foreign object preventing
          proper flow.</li>
          <li><b>Root infiltration -</b> tree roots have infested the sewer line, damaging the
          line.</li>
          <li><b>Off-grade pipe -</b> existing pipes are constructed of substandard material,
          earth settling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Video Camera Inspection Explained:</h3>
        <p>A special designed, waterproof video camera is attached to a tip of flexible
        rod which is inserted into the pipe for inspection. The high-resolution video
        camera records its findings as the rod is pushed through the pipe. Video
        images are transmitted to the camera operator via a TV screen. Images can be
        saved onto videotape or DVD.</p>

        <h3>How You Can Save Money With A Video Camera Inspection:</h3>
        <p>Video camera inspection identifies the pipeline conditions and the exact
        causes of pipeline problems.  Video camera inspection eliminates guesswork
        and unnecessary excavating, which can save your valuable time and money.</p>

        <h1>Hydro-Water Jetting</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="img/hydro-water-jetting.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>The What Of Hydro-water Jetting:</h3>
        <p>Water jetting uses high pressure water to blast through heavy blockages in sewer and drain lines.  Water Jetting has the power and speed to break through the toughest of blockages and cleans across the entire diameter of the pipe. Water jetting is a more effective way to clear sewer and drain line obstructions such as tree roots, grease, mineral deposits, and waste build up.  While cable machines only push through obstructions, water jetting thoroughly cleans and flushes the debris out of the line without damaging the infastructural integrity of the surrounding area.<p>
        <p>Restaurants and commercial facilities typically require sewer jetting, due to frequent usage and the size of the sewer and drain lines. Grease is often the cause of line blockages. Water jetting can also be used to clear line blockages for residential as well as municipal establishments.</p>

        <h3>Water Jetting Explained:</h3>
        <p>Water jetting equipment holds hundreds of gallons of water.  The flexible hose with special nozzle is attached to high pressure water tanks.  Water is pumped through the hose under varying amounts of pressure into the drain line.  The special nozzle is engineered to distribute jets of water in a forward and reverse motion.  The high pressure water streams break up blockages and wash out debris from the line at the same time.</p>

        <h3>How You Can Save Money With Hydro-water Jetting: </h3>
        <p>Maintaining sewer and drain lines regularly reduces emergency service fees and down time.  Our preventative maintenance plans are designed to save you money and are offered at a special discounted rate.</p>
        <p>Regular preventative maintenance plans can be scheduled on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis.  Set up a preventative maintenance plan with us today.</p>

        <h1>CIPP Sewer &amp; Drain Repair</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="img/cipp-sewer-drain-repair.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>The What Of CIPP Sewer &amp; Drain Repair:</h3>
        <p>Trenchless Sewer Repair is an alternative to sewer drain and rainwater pipe replacement commonly referred to as Cured-In-Place Pipe (CIPP). CIPP is where a pipe is created within the existing pipe with special epoxy resins creating the structural strength of new pipes without damage to the surrounding area.  There are two primary types of applications, the pull-in-place(PIP) method and the inversion method.</p>

        <h3>How CIPP Sewer &amp; Drain Repair Works:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identification</strong> of the problem by video camera inspection. Through a video camera inspection, we can identify the issue and recommend the best solution for the specific problem.</li>
          <li><strong>Cleaning</strong> the  sewer lines thoroughly. Once the problem and solution are identified, we clean out all waste and blockages in sewer line by high pressure water jetting in order to return the pipe back to its best functionality and diameter.  Cast pipe may require additional preparation if the pipe is badly corroded.</li>
          <li><strong>Inspection</strong> of the pipeline following high pressure water jetting. After water jetting the pipeline, it is important to inspect the line once more and visually ensure proper CIPP installation conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Installation</strong> of the CIPP liner. The exact length of liner needed is cut; a custom two-part epoxy is mixed and poured in to the felt liner.  The custom two-part epoxy is then rolled throughout the liner ensuring proper and even saturation.  Then the liner is pulled in place, or air pressure inverted, the callabration tube or bladder is inflated and the curing begins. Once the epoxy lining has cured, the bladder is extracted, leaving a complete structural sound pipe within the original pipe. To insure that the job has been performed perfectly, a video camera inspection is done to inspect the work, and we provide a copy of this to you as well.</li>
        </ol>
